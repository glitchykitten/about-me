# about-me April 29, 2021
I live in Seattle, WA.
I'm a 50 year old stay-at-home Dad.
I'm just starting to have time to look for side projects to help with.

In my past life I worked on Windows NT kernel mode software, lots of kernel mode and user mode software for audio, video, and MIDI applications on both MacOS and Windows, and a small amount of Flash/Flex software.

Right now I'm most interested in learning more Javascript (both back end and front end).

I'll contribute just about anywhere I can get good mentoring to improve my skills.  I'm not super picky as long as I'm learning and growing.
